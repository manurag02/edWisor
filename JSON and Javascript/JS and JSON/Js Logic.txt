Logic for Functional Programming

1. First function :- Write a function to take pokemon’s name as argument and display the
information of that pokemon
Logic :I have fetch all info from respective object as well object array fields, I have used FOR IN loop to fetch 
data from object arrays. If loop is used to check the condition and then FOR IN to fetch. I have used alert to 
display info. I have also validated input against spaces,null and undefined.

2. Second Function :- Write a function that takes pokemon’s name as an argument and find out
which all pokemon have that name in their “next_evolution” field.
Logic :- I have used nested for loop for fetching info from next_evolution field and If loop for validation.
I have also validated and formatted the code.

3.Third Function:- Write a function that take a “Weakness” as an input and gives the names
of all pokemon who have that Weakness. (check the weakness array in
the dataset
Logic :- I have used nested for loop for fetching info from Weakness array and If loop is used for validation.
I have also formatted and validated the input code.
