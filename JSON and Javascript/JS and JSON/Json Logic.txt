Logic for Json Ecommerce Platform

1. I have considered four main object arrays viz. User, Product, Seller and Order.
2. New elements can be added in respective arrays but in Order array we will feed info from user(userId as customer id) ,
   Product (productId as orderProductId).
3. Orders array has payment as well as order status fields to confirm order status and payment.
4. Users and Sellers can have mulitple addresses and hence I have the currency code for both user and seller.
5. Similarly Product array has In stock field for their availability and Type, Sub-type for categorization and hence easier fetching.
6. Product array also has supplier id field to identify which supplier has provided that product.
